        <h2>Our history</h2>

        <p class="description">
          For many years, Bethany has been baking the most delicious pies at her
          home. In 2013, we opened our first store in Brussels (Belgium) in a
          cosy little street near the Grand Market. People from all over the
          world fell in love with the soft cakes, spicy apple pies... The store
          became a success in no time.
          <br />
          <br />
          In 2015, no less than 100 pies were sold everyday and Bethany's Pie
          Shop moved into a larger building. After receiving many requests, it
          became clear that our next step was making it possible to order pies
          from the comfort of your own home and from anywhere in the world. You
          are now looking at the result of this: our very own webstore, making
          it possible to order Bethany's delicious pies whenever you feel like
          it!
        </p>

        <p class="description">
          Bethany is famous for using only the best ingredients. This way, we
          can make sure that our pies are absolutely the best.
